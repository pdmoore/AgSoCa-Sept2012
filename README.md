Code from the Sept. 19th, 2012, Agile SoCal programmer fishbowl led by Paul Moore and John Ryan.

Code was written in Java/Eclipse - look in the test folder for PomodoroSessionTest.java
(Java 1.7 and JUnit 4.8)

Where we left off there is one failing test since the PomodoroSession notifies all observers when tick/done events occur.
